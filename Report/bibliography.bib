	Abstract = {Today, concurrency is ubiquitous, in desktop applications, client-server systems, workflow systems, transaction processing and web services. Design of concurrent systems, particularly in the presence of communication failures, time-outs and interrupts, is still difficult and error-prone. Theoretical models of concurrency focus on expressive power and simplicity, but do not provide high-level constructs suitable for programming. We have been developing a theory, called Orc (for orchestration), and its practical applications. In this paper, we describe our philosophy in designing Orc. The guiding principle is to structure a concurrent program in a hierarchical manner, and permit interactions among subsystems in a controlled fashion. The interactions are described by value passing; the mode of communication (i.e., whether the value is passed over a channel or kept as shared data, etc.) is left unspecified.},

	Volume = {5522},
	Year = {2009},
	Abstract = {Orc was originally presented as a process calculus. It has now evolved into a full programming language, which we describe in this paper. The language has the structure and feel of a functional programming language, yet it handles many non-functional aspects effectively, including spawning of concurrent threads, time-outs and mutable state. We first describe the original concurrency combinators of the process calculus. Next we describe a small functional programming language that forms the core language. Then we show how the concurrency combinators of the process calculus and the functional core language are integrated seamlessly. The resulting language and its supporting libraries have proven very effective in describing typical concurrent computations; we demonstrate how several practical concurrent programming problems are easily solved in Orc.},
